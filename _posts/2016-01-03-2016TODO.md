Hi.

I currently work as a developer, working with C# ASP.NET MVC and WEP API on the backend, 
on the Front-End I do projects with Angularjs, jQuery, Knockoutjs and lot of javascript, 
also work with web apps with Ionic/Cordova.
 
As a lover of new technologies, I'm always learning, this year I want to learn more,
here my TODO list:

- Improve my English
- Improve my C# Skills
- Improve my NodeJs Skills
- Learning TDD and be a good at unit tests
- React (also React Native)
- Angular2
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/JohnyNogueira/TypeScript-4fun)
- [ES6](https://github.com/JohnyNogueira/my-es6-studies)
- Contribute to OSS Projects
- Attend more Events and Meetups
- Learning a new language (Ruby probably)
- Read more books

Every coming year is a good time to plan for our future. :)
